# Capstone-Project
KNN regression is a non-parametric method that predicts a numerical value for a given data point based on the values of its k closest neighbors in the training data. The k neighbors can be weighted by their distance to the data point, or by a simple average.

# Model
Selected relevant features for the model. Trained a Linear Regression model using sklearn. 
Evaluated the model with metrics: R_Square value: 97.07% Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 260.58

# Conclusion
The KNN Regression model achieved a satisfactory R-squared score of 97.07% indicating its capability to predict the House price in Bangalore. The RMSE value of 206.28 provides an understanding of the model's prediction accuracy. Further analysis and model refinement can be explored to enhance predictive capabilities.
